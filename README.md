Flowdock-userstyle
====================

The flowdock web app is fugly.  This tries to unfuglify it.

# Based on https://github.com/mebe/Flowdock-userstyle
  * ( http://flowdock.uservoice.com/forums/36827-general/suggestions/5407290-allow-for-custom-css )

* Only tested in the "new" flowdock UI

## Usage

* In Firefox, install the "User Style Manager" extension
  * Create a new user style and paste in the contents of userstyle.css
  * Only tested in FF34 on Linux with User Style Manager 1.1.1

* To use in the flowdock "app" (which is actually just a browser), copy userstyle.css into `~/Library/Application Support/Flowdock` and follow the instructions to remove the necessary lines from the file.
  * Not tested at all yet, feedback welcome

* Chrome
  * No idea (yet), feedback welcome

## Todo

* Make the "typing" popup not obscure the most recent chat line
* Make dates from previous days not be useless
* Make the popup bubble thing not be hover activated
* Make the flow navigator use a normal scrollbar
* Make the index not have hover elements
* Long nicks are a bit of a problem
